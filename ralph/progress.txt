## 2026-02-02 - TRC-033
- Implemented `run_agent_evaluation` in `src/ui/dashboard.py` to wire the "Run Evaluation" button.
- Updated `render_agent_mode` to display results and handle errors.
- Created `tests/ui/test_dashboard_wiring.py` with 10 comprehensive tests.
- Achieved 90% coverage for `src/ui/dashboard.py`.
- Fixed linting issues (E402, unused variables) and indentation bugs.
- Reviews completed: manual code review, security check (rate limiting, validation).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - **Mocking Streamlit**: Mock `st.session_state` as a class supporting both attribute and item access for realistic behavior.
  - **Async Testing**: Be careful with `asyncio.run` in sync tests; mock it out or use async test markers properly.
  - **Linting**: Run `ruff check` frequently to catch unused imports and variables early.
  - **Coverage**: Testing UI wiring requires mocking `st.*` calls and verifying call arguments.
