## 2026-02-02 - TRC-033
- Implemented `run_agent_evaluation` in `src/ui/dashboard.py` to wire the "Run Evaluation" button.
- Updated `render_agent_mode` to display results and handle errors.
- Created `tests/ui/test_dashboard_wiring.py` with 10 comprehensive tests.
- Achieved 90% coverage for `src/ui/dashboard.py`.
- Fixed linting issues (E402, unused variables) and indentation bugs.
- Reviews completed: manual code review, security check (rate limiting, validation).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - **Mocking Streamlit**: Mock `st.session_state` as a class supporting both attribute and item access for realistic behavior.
  - **Async Testing**: Be careful with `asyncio.run` in sync tests; mock it out or use async test markers properly.
  - **Linting**: Run `ruff check` frequently to catch unused imports and variables early.
  - **Coverage**: Testing UI wiring requires mocking `st.*` calls and verifying call arguments.

## 2026-02-02 - TRC-035
- Implemented `src/ui/components/demo_loader.py` with simulated attack generation using `VulnerableTestAgent`.
- Updated `src/ui/dashboard.py` to integrate demo mode and fix several security/logic issues.
- Created `src/ui/state_utils.py` for centralized state management.
- Implemented robust error handling and safety checks for demo execution.
- Added `tests/ui/test_demo_loader.py` with 100% coverage.
- Updated `tests/ui/test_dashboard_wiring.py` to cover new error handling paths.
- Reviews completed: code-review, silent-failure-hunt, security, simplification.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - **Streamlit Testing**: Global module patching (`sys.modules["streamlit"] = mock`) is more reliable than local patching.
  - **Security**: Always validate object types before display/deserialization (`str(obj)` is risky). Use `secrets.token_urlsafe` for sessions.
  - **State Management**: Centralize state keys and reset logic to avoid duplication and inconsistencies.
  - **Testing**: When mocking multiple buttons in one render pass, use `side_effect` to distinguish them based on label/key.

## 2026-02-02 - TRC-036
- Implemented `src/ui/components/sdk_connection.py` with SDK Integration panel.
- Added "SDK Integration" tab to Agent Testing mode in `src/ui/dashboard.py`.
- Framework selector supports: LangChain, LangGraph, MCP, Custom.
- Auto-generated session ID and webhook URL displayed for each session.
- Framework-specific code snippets with Python syntax highlighting.
- Quick start guides for each framework integration.
- Auth token input with HTML escaping for security.
- Created `tests/ui/test_sdk_connection.py` with 34 tests, 94% coverage.
- Updated existing dashboard tests for 5-tab layout.
- Reviews completed: ruff lint (all checks passed), mypy (no issues in new file).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - **Tab Count Changes**: When adding new tabs, update ALL existing tests that mock `st.tabs()` return value count.
  - **Module Caching**: Tests with `sys.modules` mocks can conflict when run together. Add new mocked modules early.
  - **Type Safety**: Use explicit casts (e.g., `str()`) when returning from session_state to satisfy mypy.
  - **Code Snippets**: Use f-strings with doubled braces `{{}}` for dict literals in generated code.

## 2026-02-02 - TRC-037
- Implemented `src/ui/components/remote_agent_config.py` with Remote Agent Configuration panel.
- Added "Remote Agent" tab (6th tab) to Agent Testing mode in `src/ui/dashboard.py`.
- Features implemented:
  - Agent endpoint URL input with regex validation
  - Auth configuration: Bearer token, API key header, or None
  - Request format selector: OpenAI-compatible or custom JSON template with validation
  - Response format selector: text or JSON path extraction
  - Test connection button with async HTTP client (httpx)
  - Configuration summary display with metrics
  - Session state persistence
- Created `tests/ui/test_remote_agent_config.py` with 81 tests, 88% coverage.
- Updated `tests/ui/test_dashboard_wiring.py` and `tests/ui/test_dashboard_report.py` for 6-tab layout.
- Reviews completed: ruff lint (all checks passed), mypy (all issues resolved).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - **Function Naming**: Avoid `test_` prefix in source code function names to prevent pytest from collecting them as tests (renamed `test_connection_async` to `check_connection_async`).
  - **Tab Count Updates**: Systematic grep for `st.tabs.return_value` across all test files when adding tabs.
  - **Columns Mocking**: Use `side_effect` with different return values when `st.columns()` is called multiple times with different specs.
  - **Type Safety**: Use explicit type casts or annotations (e.g., `result: dict[str, Any]`) to avoid mypy "Returning Any" errors.
  - **Modern Python Types**: Use `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]` for UP045 compliance.
  - **JSON Path Validation**: Simple validation patterns work well for basic JSONPath expressions.
