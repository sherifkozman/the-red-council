## 2026-02-02 - TRC-009
- Implemented OWASP Agentic Top 10 evaluation methods in `src/agents/agent_judge.py`
- Implemented robust fail-fast and fail-safe mechanisms for security checks
- Addressed Critical/High security findings:
  - Fixed ReDoS vulnerability in regex
  - Fixed broken entropy math (used Counter)
  - Fixed Exception Swallowing (now returns High Risk failure)
  - Fixed Dummy Secret logic (explicitly disabled if missing)
  - Added configurable thresholds and weight validation
- Achieved 100% pass rate on 13 integration tests
- Reviews completed: code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, security, code-simplifier
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - **ReDoS**: Avoid `\b` with quantifiers on untrusted input; use possessive quantifiers or simpler patterns.
  - **Entropy**: `dict.fromkeys` destroys frequency information; use `collections.Counter`.
  - **Fail-Safe**: In security monitoring, a broken monitor must raise a HIGH severity alert, not fail silently.
  - **Floating Point**: Validate weights with tolerance (`abs(x-1) > 1e-6`).
  - **Heuristics**: Regex is brittle; combine with entropy or semantic analysis where possible.
